# Obstacle Avoiding Robot

## Overview
This project is an **Obstacle Avoiding Robot** built using **Arduino** and **Ultrasonic sensors**. The robot uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect obstacles in its path and autonomously navigates by avoiding them. It demonstrates basic concepts of **robotics**, **sensor integration**, and **autonomous control**.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection**: Uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect obstacles in real-time.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot navigates autonomously by avoiding obstacles.
- **Motor Control**: Controls the movement of the robot using **DC motors** and **motor driver circuits**.
- **Real-time Response**: Reacts immediately when an obstacle is detected.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno** (or any compatible Arduino board)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** for obstacle detection
- **DC Motors** (2x for movement)
- **L298N Motor Driver** (or any motor driver IC)
- **Chassis** for robot body
- **Jumper wires**, **breadboard**, and **resistors** (for connections)

## Software
The Arduino code can be uploaded directly to the Arduino board using the **Arduino IDE**.
